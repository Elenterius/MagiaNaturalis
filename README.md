# Magia Naturalis

>"One must know Death in order to understand the Meaning of Life"

This is the legacy repository of my 11 year old (2014-2015) addon mod for Thaumcraft 4 which, I released under my former
username (TrinaryBrain) on
the [minecraftforum.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20170720130055/http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2328507-wip-thaumcraft-4-2-addon-magia-naturalis-v0-1-5b).

There will be no new features, but you can expect bug fixes and improvements when requested.

## Credits

Special thanks to Itaros, Abdo and Thaumatarge.

## License

All code is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

All artwork is currently ARR because I don't remember if they are all mine and several textures are either based on or
modified Thaumcraft textures.

## Development Setup

The gradle scripts have been updated to make the project compile again. I recommend the use of IntelliJ when working
with this repo. The RetroFuturaGradle plugin is pre-configured and all you need to do is to run the gradle task
`setupDecompWorkspace`.

### Contributing

Pull Request for new features are welcome. If you are interested in continuing the development of this mod let me know
on discord.
